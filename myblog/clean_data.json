Two common, safe ways are (A) create a new GitHub repo and push your existing local repo (preserves history — recommended), or (B) create a new repo, clone it, and copy your project files into the clone (start fresh remote history). Below I give step‑by‑step commands for both, with examples using a GitHub personal access token (PAT) and an alternative using the GitHub CLI (gh). Replace names and the token with your values.\r\n\r\nImportant notes before you start\r\n\r\nCreate a PAT in GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens. For private repos you need the repo scope; for public-only, public_repo may be enough.\r\nNever paste tokens into public logs or share them. Use an environment variable (GITHUB_TOKEN) or gh auth login.\r\nDecide whether you want to preserve your local commit history. If yes, use option A.",

This time the form is no longer empty (unbound) so the HTML form will be populated with the data previously submitted, where it can be edited and corrected as required.\r\n\r\nIf is_valid() is True, we’ll now be able to find all the validated form data in its cleaned_data attribute. We can use this data to update the database or do other processing before sending an HTTP redirect to the browser telling it where to go next.",
